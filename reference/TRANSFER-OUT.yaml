    ### Follow this step-by-step guide to learn how payment distribution by wire transfer works on the internet.

    The funds or money distribution by wire transfer is a service that simplifies financial management. By using it, you will be able to make payments from a single bank account to the accounts of your users.

    <!-- theme: warning -->
    > #### To keep in mind
    >Due to our risk policies, the available payment methods and the integration type may vary once you complete the affiliation. We will tell you how to proceed if this process applies to your merchant.

    > This feature is only available in Colombia, México, Chile and Peru.

    ## The payment process

    ![Proceso de dispersión con transferencia](//images.ctfassets.net/mmjbm94f6iyd/61KDNemDCoE0y5x0mNiFaM/8bc2f16394fda15377499eff667f31b7/Payout__Transfer_out__M__xico.png)

    ## Stages of the payment process

    A funds' distribution process usually consists of 7 stages:

    ### 1. Funds top-up on the Kushki distribution account

    It is necessary to check the funds of your merchant in Kushki, because if you do not have funds, the distribution process cannot be carried out. We recommend you to top up your account in order to distribute the money to the different accounts of your customers without any complications.

    ### 2. Data request

    At this stage, the bank account details and name of the user who will receive the money are collected. These are submitted to Kushki to be validated and processed.

    ### 3. Verification of funds

    Kushki receives the data that you submitted and validates that your business account has enough funds to process the payment distribution. The balance will be immediately deducted from your Kushki distribution account.

    ### 4. Authorization

    Once we have verified that you have sufficient funds in your distribution account, we provide a transaction reference. At this stage, the distribution process is initiated and will be credited in a few minutes to the user's bank account. 

    ### 5. Delivery of funds

    All transactions generated will be sent in real time to the bank and the bank will deliver the funds to the users' accounts.

    ### 6. Notification to the merchant

    The bank will notify us of the results of each transaction, and we will notify you immediately.

    ### 7. Notification to the user

    __This step is optional, but very useful__, since, once we notify you the result of the transaction, you can share it with your users.
