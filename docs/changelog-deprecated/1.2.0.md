# Changelog

**Stay up to date with changes and updates to the Kushki API.**

We used the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) standard (**YYYY-MM-DD**) for dates, the Semantic Versioning (**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**) for version numbers, increasing the:

1. **MAJOR** version when we make incompatible API changes,
2. **MINOR** version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Types of changes

  - List all chargebacks: lists all chargebacks in INITIALIZED status generated up to 72 hours before the time of the query.
  - Upload evidence: You can upload files through this endpoint that serve as evidence to help us resolve the chargeback in your favor.
  - Update a chargeback: Depending on the type of chargeback, it will be necessary to update the chargeback with the necessary evidence.
