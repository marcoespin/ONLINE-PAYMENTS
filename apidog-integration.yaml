        Request a card token that can later be used to charge a customer using the `charge`
        endpoint.

        <div class="danger">
          <p><strong>Important to consider:</strong> If you are using this option to request the token, <strong>be sure to comply</strong> with all the PCI requirements to handle card data on your servers.</p>

        > #### Token expiration
        >
        >Tokens will expire in 30 minutes and can be used only for a single transaction (even if the transaction was wrong). You will need to request a new token when it expires.

        > **Note: The token delivered by Kushki only encrypts and sends information. If you want to store the card information for future purchases, go to the [One-Click & Scheduled Payments](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/one-click-and-scheduled-payments) section.**

        ### Recurring transactions*

        <!-- theme: none -->
        > #### This functionality is available for the following models:
        >
        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☐ Aggregator

        Send the  `transactionMode` parameter for request a recurring charge `token` that can later be used to create a recurring charge as follows:

        - **initialRecurrence**: Merchants must generate a token by sending complete card information (number, expiration date, cvv, etc) to register it. A token will be returned to continue the payment.

        - **subsequentRecurrence**: The merchant will be able to generate a token by sending the data of the previously sent card with an `initialRecurrence`, with this the merchant will be able to omit the entry of the CVV and make a charge later with the current flow.

        > **NOTE**: If you want to process a recurring charge with an external engine, you must skip sending the CVV.

        <hr>

        ### Do you want to validate an account?*

        <!-- theme: none -->
        > #### This functionality is available for the following models:
        >
        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☐ Aggregator

        <!-- theme: warning -->
        > ####  Service not available in Mexico 🇲🇽

        Send the `transactionMode` parameter as `accountValidation ` for request an account validation token that can be later used to verify an account using the [card/v1/validation](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/card/operations/create-a-card-v-1-validation) endpoint. Make sure you set the totalAmount to `0`.

        In the `url` field will be the url that will need to be displayed to the cardholder for 3D Secure authentication, if necessary. For more detailed information, visit the [3D Secure API authentication](https://docs.kushki.com/mx/card-payments/3d-secure/3ds-via-api) guide.

        For more information about 3D Secure, see [Accept payments with 3DS](https://docs.kushki.com/mx/card-payments/3d-secure/3ds-overview).

        > **NOTE:** To enable 3DS in test mode in your merchant, it is required to have an additional configuration performed by Kushki.

        #### callbackUrl 

        The callback function will let you know if the 3D Secure authentication was successful or if there were any problems during the process. This url will be called automatically after authenticating, through a 301 redirect by making a GET request to the url sent in the `callbackUrl` field, sending the parameters of the response in the url (path parameters).

        > **Note**: The boolean parameter sucess will indicate whether the transaction was successfully authenticated (`true`) or if there was a problem with 3D Secure authentication (`false`). If it is `true`, you can proceed to make the charge. If `false`, the cardholder will have up to 3 attempts to retry authentication before the transaction is declined.

Obtain a [card token](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/card%2Foperations%2Fcreate-a-card-v-1-token#recurring-transactions) by sending `initialRecurrence` in the `transactionMode` parameter.\n2. Use the obtained token in step 1 to make an initial charge (see the example named _Initial recurrence charge for subscriptions_).\n3. Make sure you save the **transactionReference** number of the charge completed in step 2.\n4. For the subsequent transactions, obtain a [card token](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/card%2Foperations%2Fcreate-a-card-v-1-token#recurring-transactions) by sending `subsequentRecurrence ` in the `transactionMode` parameter.\n5. Make a charge by sending the **transactionReference** number in the `initialRecurrenceReference` field (see the example named _Subsequent recurrence charge for subscriptions_)\n\n\n\n\n"

You can request the deferred options for a specific BIN from your frontend with our [API](/docs/online-payments/card/operations/get-a-card-v-1-deferred) or with one of our [frontend libraries](/kushki-libraries).**\n\n\n\n#### México\n\n* \"03\" = Months with no interest.\n\nFor **months with no interest** in México, there is a minimum amount depending on the term to defer the transaction.\n\n* 3 months: $300 MXN\n* 6 months: $600 MXN\n* 9 months: $900 MXN\n* 12 months: $1,200 MXN\n* 18 months: $,1800 MXN\n\n### Chile, Colombia and Peru\n\nFor Chile, Colombia and Peru, deferred transactions vary depending on the affiliation model.\n\n\n#### For Acquiring\n\nFor deferred charges in **Colombian**, **Peruvian**, and **Chilean** merchants, you have to set the `deferred` object that includes the `creditType`, `graceMonths`, and `months` parameters.\n\nIn all countries, `graceMonths` must be sent with the value of **`00`**.\n\n| Country | Deferred Payment Type | `creditType` Value |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Colombia / Perú** | Standard Installments | `01` |\n| **Chile** | Issuer Installments (`Cuotas Emisor`) | `01` |\n| **Chile** | Merchant Installments (`Cuotas Comercio`) | `03` |\n\n### Example: Credit Type `01` (Colombia, Perú, and Chile's Issuer Installments)\n\n```json\n\_ \"deferred\": {\n\_ \_ \"graceMonths\": \"00\",\n\_ \_ \"creditType\": \"01\",\n\_ \_ \"months\": 6\n\_ }\n```\n\n\n### Example: Credit Type 03 (Chile's \"Cuotas Comercio\" Installments)\n\n```json\n\"deferred\": {\n\_ \_ \"graceMonths\": \"00\",\n\_ \_ \"creditType\": \"03\",\n\_ \_ \"months\": 3\n\_ }\n```\n\n\n\n#### For Aggregator model\n\nFor deferred charges in Colombian, Chilean or Peruvian merchants in aggregator model, you can send the number of installments in the `months` parameter.\n ```json\n \"months\": 3,\n  ```\n\n### Do you have your own 3DS authentication engine?*\n\n\nMake sure you include the `threeDomainSecure` object in your request.\n\n\\* **Applies in Mexico 🇲🇽 , Peru 🇵🇪, Colombia 🇨🇴, and Chile 🇨🇱.**\n\n\n### Do you have your own subscriptions engine?*\n\n\nIn case you have your own subscriptions engine (**only PCI Compliance merchants**), you can follow the steps below to process recurring charges:\n\n1. Send `initialRecurrence` in the `transactionMode` parameter and process the charge. For this initial transaction, you must send the CVV.\n3. Make sure you save the **transactionReference** number of the charge completed in step 1.\n4. For the subsequent transactions, send `subsequentRecurrence ` in the `transactionMode` parameter and include the **transactionReference** number in the `initialRecurrenceReference` field. Now you can omit the CVV.\n>An alternative option to process external subscriptions is by sending the parameter `externalSubscriptionID`.

                    Send this object as another transactional notification option. In case you have a **Webhook** created through the Console, the notification will be sent to both the **API** and the **Console** channels. It means they will not be mutually exclusive.

                    The notifications will be seen in the Webhooks Notifications dashboard, and they will have a new field called Configuration, which will identify the source of the notification.

        > #### This functionality is available for the following models:
        >
        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☑ Aggregator

        Refund a transaction identified by its `ticketNumber`. The `ticketNumber` is provided when a charge or a deferred charge is successful. Remember that the refund process is semi-automatic, so the confirmation you are receiving is to confirm you that the process has begun successfully.

        <hr>

        ### Partial refunds

        For partial refunds it is necessary to send the `amount` object.

        > Partial refunds are only available in ***Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru***

        #### Partial refund request example

        ```json
        {
          "fullResponse": "v2",
          "amount": {
            "subtotalIva": 8737,

                    Send this object as another transactional notification option. In case you have a **Webhook** created through the Console, the notification will be sent to both the **API** and the **Console** channels. It means they will not be mutually exclusive.

                    The notifications will be seen in the Webhooks Notifications dashboard, and they will have a new field called Configuration, which will identify the source of the notification.

        Use this endpoint to request an authorization using a `token` provided by Kushki.

        You authorize a card payment when you want to verify that sufficient credit exists on a customer's credit card before processing a sale. The cardholder's credit limit will be reduced by the amount of the authorization until the authorization is captured or expires.

        - **In Colombia, Perú, México and Chile**, the authorization will expire after 28 days for credit cards and after 7 days for debit cards from the time of request.

        <!-- theme: warning -->

        >
        > We are working on our beta version. Stay tuned for its official release! You can also contact your account manager for more information.


        **NOTE**: An authorization can be canceled through the [Void a transaction](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1v1~1charges~1{ticketNumber}/delete) endpoint. After performing the cancellation, no reauthorizations can be made on the canceled transaction.

        ### Do you have your own 3DS authentication engine?*

        Make a preauthorization (two-step payment) without the need for a card token.

        <!-- theme: danger -->
        > #### This is an On-demand service only available for PCI DSS compliance companies.


        You preauthorize a card payment when you want to verify that sufficient credit exists on a customer's credit card before processing a sale. The cardholder's credit limit will be reduced by the amount of the authorization until the authorization is captured or expires.

        - **In Colombia, Perú, México and Chile**, the authorization will expire after 28 days for credit cards and after 7 days for debit cards from the time of request.


        <!-- theme: none -->
        > #### This functionality is available for the following models:
        >
        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☐ Aggregator

        ### Limitations
        - Only available for **Acquirer model** in Chile 🇨🇱, Colombia 🇨🇴, México 🇲🇽, and Perú 🇵🇪.</br>
        - Only available for Visa and Mastercard.
        - Not compatible with Siftscience nor TransUnion antifraud tools.
        - Not compatible with Kushki 3DS authentication tool (Use instead your own 3DS authentication engine).
        - Not compatible with Kushki OTP authentication.



        **NOTE**: An authorization can be canceled through the [Void a transaction](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1v1~1charges~1{ticketNumber}/delete) endpoint. After performing the cancellation, no reauthorizations can be made on the canceled transaction.

        ### Do you have your own 3DS authentication engine?*


        Make sure you include the `threeDomainSecure` object in your request.

        ### Do you have your own subscriptions engine?*


        In case you have your own subscriptions engine (**only PCI Compliance merchants**), you can follow the steps below to process recurring charges:

        1. Send `initialRecurrence` in the `transactionMode` parameter and process the preauthorization. For this initial transaction, you must send the CVV.
        3. Make sure you save the **transactionReference** number of the charge completed in step 1.
        4. For the subsequent transactions, send `subsequentRecurrence ` in the `transactionMode` parameter and include the **transactionReference** number in the `initialRecurrenceReference` field. Now you can omit the CVV.
        >An alternative option to process external subscriptions is by sending the parameter `externalSubscriptionID`. Click [here](https://docs.kushki.com/mx/en/recurring-payments/external-subscriptions#1-recurring-transactions-without-cvv-with-external-subscription-engine) for more information.

        Use this endpoint to extend the amount or effect of the [Authorize payments](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1card~1v1~1preAuthorization/post) endpoint.

        > #### Service available in the following countries:
        >
        >  Colombia, México, Perú and Chile.

        >
        > We are working on our beta version. Stay tuned for its official release! You can also contact your account manager for more information.

        If payment is not captured within 7 days for debit cards and 28 days for credit cards, **the issuing bank may return the withheld funds to the cardholder.**

        The currency must be the same as the [authorization](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1card~1v1~1preAuthorization/post).

        An amount of $0 can be sent in the reauthorization to extend the date of capture.

        The reauthorization can be for an amount greater than the [authorization](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1card~1v1~1preAuthorization/post).

        **NOTE**: A reauthorization can be canceled through the [Void a transaction](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1v1~1charges~1{ticketNumber}/delete) endpoint. After performing the cancellation, no reauthorizations can be made on the canceled transaction.

        Capture an authorized or reauthorized card payment using the `ticketNumber` provided as a response of the [Authorize payments](../reference/CARD.yaml/paths/~1card~1v1~1preAuthorization/post) request. **The capture can only be done with the `ticketNumber` of the authorization, not of a reauthorization.**


        >The maximum amount to be captured may be 10% higher than the total amount of the initial authorization plus the n reauthorizations made that have not been cancelled.

        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☑ Aggregator

        Validate the OTP provided by the client with the `secureId` from the token request. The client has 5 minutes and also 3 attempts to validate the OTP with the same `secureId`.

        ## Sandbox

        Kushki allows simulating an approved OTP validation. Use the following values depending on the currency that belongs to your credentials:

        * CLP: `150`
        * COP: `555`
        * USD: `155`
        * PEN: `155`
        * MXN: `555`

        Any other OTP value will result in a declined validation.

        Returns an object with the information related to the credit-card bin (**first eight (8) or ten (10) digits**). For Chilean merchants, the response is helpful to decide whether to continue with the request of a card token (when `cardType` is `CREDIT`), or with the request of a card async token (when `cardType` is `DEBIT`).

      summary: Create a recurring charge
      deprecated: false
      description: |
        <!-- theme: none -->
        > #### This functionality is available for the following models:
        >
        > ☑ Acquirer</br>
        > ☑ Aggregator

        Create a recurring charge with a `token` provided by Kushki which represents the customer's credit card.

        ### Payment Execution

        Kushki processes __recurring charges to the registered card automatically__. Payments will be executed and repeated according to the amount and period indicated in the subscription. 

        The billing logic starts running every day __from 6am GMT-5__. Make sure that the subscription was created before this time if you want the first payment to be executed on the same day of registration. Alternatively, your customer can register his/her card some days in advance, before Kushki executes the first charge. When creating a subscription, you must indicate the __start date `startDate`__.

        #### Retries

        If a payment is rejected, Kushki has a retry logic to try to recover the charge. By default, __there are 3 retries for 3 days in a row from the payment day originally defined in `startDate`__. For example, for a monthly subscription with start date: `10-01-2021`, with a rejection on `10-02-2021`, payment will be retried until `13-02-2021`, 3 times each day, for a total of 9 payment attempts.

        You can modify the retry days for a subscription and also define specific charging days.

        If the __last charge attempt was declined__, we may send you a notification via WebHook informing you about it. In these cases, we recommend you to contact the card owner and offer him/her a set of alternatives for paying the fee that could not be charged; for example, changing the registered credit card and generating a [charge on demand](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/one-click-and-scheduled-payments%2Foperations%2Fcreate-a-subscription-v-1-card-1) only for one time. Kushki will continue executing automatic charges over the following periods.

        ##### Customize retry logic

        You can customize the collection retry logic by submitting the `retryConfiguration` object as follows:

        1. `retryType`:"schedule". If you choose schedule, you can specify in the `value` field you can specify in `value` how often the collection will be reattempted. 
        In the next example, the collection will be reattempted 3 times per day every 2 days for the entire month.
        ```json
        {
           "retryConfiguration":{
              "retryType":"schedule",
              "value":[2]
           }
        }
        ```

        2. `retryType`:"fixed". Send the specific days of the month to retry. Ex. 10th, 20th, 30th.
          In the following example, the charge will only be reattempted 3 times a day, on the 10th, 20th and 30th of the corresponding month.
         ```json
        {
           "retryConfiguration":{
              "retryType":"fixed",
              "value":[10,20,30]
           }
        }
        ```
        >Send the `retryType` as `fixed` if you do not want to retry collection for the entire month.
        If the __last charge attempt was declined__, we may send you a notification via WebHook informing you about it. In these cases, we recommend you to contact the card owner and offer them a set of alternatives for paying the fee that could not be charged; for example, changing the registered credit card and generating an [One-click payment](https://docs.kushki.com/mx/en/one-time-payments/card/on-demand) only for one time. Kushki will continue executing automatic charges over the following periods.

        <!-- theme: warning -->
        > #### Important!
        >
        > When customizing retries it should be noted that once the first collection is initiated, if it fails and retries are initiated, any updates to retries will be applied until the next subscription period (weekly, monthly, yearly).

        #### Periodicity

        You can choose the frequency of recurring charges by submitting any of these values in the required `periodicity` field:

        * **daily**: every 1 day.
        * **weekly**: every 7 days.
        * **biweekly**: every 15 days.
        * **monthly**: every 30 days.
        * **threefortnights**: every six weeks or 42 days.
        * **bimonthly**: every 60 days.
        * **quarterly**: every 90 days.
        * **fourmonths**: every 120 days.
        * **halfyearly**: every 180 days
        * **yearly**: every 360 days.
        * **custom**: for [one click payments](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/one-click-and-scheduled-payments%2Foperations%2Fcreate-a-subscription-v-1-card-1).

(MSI)\n\nFor **months with no interest** in México, there is a minimum amount depending on the term to defer the transaction.\n\n* 3 months: $300 MXN\n* 6 months: $600 MXN\n* 9 months: $900 MXN\n* 12 months: $1,200 MXN\n* 18 months: $,1800 MXN\n\n### Chile, Colombia and Peru\n\nFor Chile, Colombia and Peru, deferred transactions vary depending on the affiliation model:\n\n#### For Acquiring\n\nFor deferred charges in **Colombian**, **Peruvian**, and **Chilean** merchants, you have to set the `deferred` object that includes the `creditType`, `graceMonths`, and `months` parameters.\n\nIn all countries, `graceMonths` must be sent with the value of **`00`**.\n\n### Example: Credit Type `01` (Colombia, Perú, and Chile's Issuer Installments)\n\n```json\n\_ \"deferred\": {\n\_ \_ \"graceMonths\": \"00\",\n\_ \_ \"creditType\": \"01\",\n\_ \_ \"months\": 6\n\_ }\n```\n\n\n### Example: Credit Type 03 (Chile's \"Cuotas Comercio\" Installments)\n\n```json\n\"deferred\": {\n\_ \_ \"graceMonths\": \"00\",\n\_ \_ \"creditType\": \"03\",\n\_ \_ \"months\": 3\n\_ }\n```\n\n\n\n#### For Aggregator model\n\nFor deferred charges in Colombian, Chilean or Peruvian merchants in aggregator model, you can send the number of installments in the `months` parameter.\n ```\n \"months\": 3,\n  ```\n<!-- theme: warning -->\n> #### Important!\n>\n> In any case, you should consult the request deferred options method as these vary according to the BIN of the card.\n"

        > There is a maximum time of 7 calendar days to make the capture. After that time, the amount withheld from the credit card will be released. Transbank does not allow the release of the approved amount if it is not captured within 7 days.

        Use this endpoint to request an authorization on an existing async card recurring charge, identified by its `subscriptionId`, created in the **Init an async card recurring charge** endpoint.

        You authorize a credit card payment when you want to verify that sufficient credit exists on a customer's credit card before processing a sale. The cardholder's credit limit will be reduced by the amount of the authorization until the authorization is captured or expires.

        The Get Subscription Token service generates a `subscriptionId` by providing the cardholder and card details. Unlike the Get Payout Token service, which is intended for one-time payouts, this service allows you to send funds multiple times to a valid card using the Push Funds service.

        The **Card Push Funds Service** enables users to send funds directly to a card by providing essential transaction details. The request should also contain card details, the transaction amount, and the `paymentType`.

        <!-- theme: warning -->
        > #### Product in beta version 🇵🇪 🇨🇱 🔐👨‍💻
        >
        > We are working on our beta version. Stay tuned for its official release! You can also contact your account manager for more information.

        <!-- theme: warning -->
        > #### Service available in the following countries:
        >
        > Perú 🇵🇪, and Chile 🇨🇱.  
        > Check out our full [list of services by country](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/services-by-country)

        The **Push Funds** service offers two integration options based on your PCI compliance level:

        1. **Without token**: Merchants with PCI compliance can send the `card` object directly and omit the token.
        2. **With token**: Available for both PCI-compliant and non-PCI-compliant merchants. Non-PCI-compliant merchants must obtain the token using the **hosted fields** library.

        Choose the option that best suits your business needs while ensuring compliance with security standards.

        The Push Funds in subscriptions service allows you to send payments to a previously registered card using a subscription-based model. To initiate a transaction, you must provide the `subscriptionId` as a path parameter. This `subscriptionId` is obtained from the front end using [Kushki.js Hosted Fields](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/libraries/branches/CARD-PAYOUTS/kushkijs-hosted-fields/CardPayouts/Methods/initCardPayoutToken) or from the Get Subscription Token service, which securely collects and tokenizes card details.

        The **Get Transaction Status** service allows you to retrieve the status of a **card payout** transaction. To query the transaction, you must include **only one** of the following parameters in the request path:

        - **`transactionReference`**: The unique identifier assigned to the transaction by Kushki.  
        - **`clientTransactionId`**: The identifier assigned to the transaction by the merchant.

        > If you receive any of the errors listed in the [error codes table](https://preview.docs.kushki.com/pe/payouts/card/error-codes), you must use the **`clientTransactionId`** to retrieve the transaction status.

        ### Alternative: Webhook for Card Payouts

        Instead of polling the transaction status, you can use the **card payout webhook**, which automatically notifies your system about transaction status updates in real time. For more details, refer to the [Card Payout Webhook documentation](https://preview.docs.kushki.com/pe/notifications/payment-distribution/webhook-card-payout).

        The Delete Subscription service allows you to remove a subscribed card by sending the `subscriptionId` as a path parameter. Once deleted, the card can no longer receive payouts through the Push Funds service.

        Before requesting a `token` for a Transfer Out transaction, you first need to load the banks, so that the final client can select from the list. You only need to consume this endpoint.

        The response you will get, is an array of the banks with its name and code.

        >In the case of Colombia 🇨🇴, if the transaction is by phone number, you don't need to use this endpoint. For the transactions by account number, the bank list will depend on the secure rules configured for your customer.

        Before requesting a `token` for a Transfer Out transaction, you first need to load the banks, so that the final client can select from the list. You only need to consume this endpoint.

        The response you will get, is an array of the banks with its name, code and type.

        >In the case of Colombia 🇨🇴, if the transaction is by phone number, you don't need to use this endpoint. For the transactions by account number, the bank list will depend on the secure rules configured for your customer.

                  Send this object as another transactional notification option for your customers. In case you have a **Webhook** created through the Console, the notification will be sent to both the **API** and the **Console** channels. It means they will not be mutually exclusive.

                  The notifications will be seen in the Webhooks Notifications dashboard, and they will have a new field called Configuration, which will identify the source of the notification.

      description: |-
        > There is a maximum time of 7 calendar days to make the capture. After that time, the amount withheld from the credit card will be released. Transbank does not allow the release of the approved amount if it is not captured within 7 days.

        Use this endpoint to request an authorization using a `token` provided by Kushki. 

        You authorize a card payment when you want to verify that sufficient credit exists on a customer's credit card before processing a sale. The cardholder's credit limit will be reduced by the amount of the authorization until the authorization is captured or expires.

        > There is a maximum time of 7 calendar days to make the capture. After that time, the amount withheld from the credit card will be released. Transbank does not allow the release of the approved amount if it is not captured within 7 days.

        Use this endpoint to request an authorization using a `token` provided by Kushki. 

        You authorize a card payment when you want to verify that sufficient credit exists on a customer's credit card before processing a sale. The cardholder's credit limit will be reduced by the amount of the authorization until the authorization is captured or expires.

        This endpoint only works when the Split Payment mode is enabled. The Split Payment collection mode allows dividing the payment of one transaction into two recipient merchants:  the main merchant and the Commission Recipient Merchant.

        Use this endpoint to calculate the amount that would be paid on a given transaction to the Commission Recipient Merchant.
        > The Split Payment collection mode is only available on-demand.

        > This endpoint has been deprecated. Instead, use the **List all chargebacks by status** endpoint which has the same functionality and adds a filter by status type

        A chargeback is a mechanism created to solve those charges made to a credit or debit card that are not recognized. It is a way to protect the cardholder from charges made without their consent.

        It is generated when the cardholder communicates directly with the issuing bank to notify that he does not recognize a charge made to his credit or debit card by your company. At that time, the cardholder's issuing bank sends the chargeback request to the merchant's bank.

        When a chargeback is received, contacting your customer is always the best first step. In the event that doesn't work, you can submit the necessary evidence to help us resolve the chargeback in your favor.

        This endpoint lists all chargebacks in INITIALIZED [status](https://kushki.zendesk.com/hc/es/articles/1500002081081--Cu%C3%A1l-es-el-flujo-de-un-contracargo-Qu%C3%A9-tiempo-tiene-cada-etapa-)  generated up to 72 hours before the time of the query.

        A chargeback is a mechanism created to solve those charges made to a credit or debit card that are not recognized. It is a way to protect the cardholder from charges made without their consent.

        It is generated when the cardholder communicates directly with the issuing bank to notify that he does not recognize a charge made to his credit or debit card by your company. At that time, the cardholder's issuing bank sends the chargeback request to the merchant's bank.

        When a chargeback is received, contacting your customer is always the best first step. In the event that doesn't work, you can submit the necessary evidence to help us resolve the chargeback in your favor.

        This endpoint lists all chargebacks in **INITIALIZED, APPROVAL or DECLINED** [status](https://kushki.zendesk.com/hc/es/articles/1500002081081--Cu%C3%A1l-es-el-flujo-de-un-contracargo-Qu%C3%A9-tiempo-tiene-cada-etapa-)  generated up to 72 hours before the time of the query.

        You can upload files through this endpoint that serve as evidence to help us resolve the chargeback in your favor. Allowed file extensions are pdf, png, and jpeg. **The size of each file must not exceed 2 MB and the total number of files to be uploaded must not exceed 10 MB.** It should be as clear as possible, with accurate information that helps make the chargeback in favor of your business. The file must be base64 encoded and is limited to one file per request.

        When uploading a file, an id will be returned to you which you can later use to link the corresponding files to a chargeback.

        Specification of supported documents for a chargeback:

        | **Document** | **File extension** | **Size** |
        |---|:---:|:---:|

        Depending on the type of [chargeback](https://kushki.zendesk.com/hc/es/articles/360060696294--Por-qu%C3%A9-ocurren-los-chargebacks-), it will be necessary to update the chargeback with the necessary evidence, uploaded through the [Upload Evidence API](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/chargebacks/operations/create-a-asset-v-1-file), so that it can be evaluated. **It is necessary to attach at least one letter and one document file**. The total size of the documents must not exceed 10MB and must be a supported document type. When the chargeback is updated with evidence, the chargeback status will change to "Pending" indicating that the evidence was successfully received.

            Send `03` for Mexico's Months Without Interest (MSI) and Chile's Merchant Installments (Cuotas Comercio).

            If [Request Deferred Options](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/card/operations/get-a-card-v-1-deferred) method returns `all` for Issuer Installments (in **Chile**, **Colombia**, and **Peru**), you must send `01` when using the **Kushki Acquiring** model.

            For all other cases, send the specific value returned in the `type` field of the [Request Deferred Options](https://api-docs.kushkipagos.com/docs/online-payments/card/operations/get-a-card-v-1-deferred) response.

        Send this object as another transactional notification option. In case you have a **Webhook** created through the Console, the notification will be sent to both the **API** and the **Console** channels. It means they will not be mutually exclusive.

        The notifications will be seen in the Webhooks Notifications dashboard, and they will have a new field called Configuration, which will identify the source of the notification.

        **Example:**

        ```Example
