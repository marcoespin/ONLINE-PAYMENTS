  Send this object as another transactional notification option. In case you have a **Webhook** created through the Console, the notification will be sent to both the **API** and the **Console** channels. It means they will not be mutually exclusive.

  The notifications will be seen in the Webhooks Notifications dashboard, and they will have a new field called Configuration, which will identify the source of the notification.

  **Example:**

  ```Example
  {
    "webhooks": [
      {
        "events": [
          "approvedTransaction",
          "declinedTransaction"
        ],
        "headers": [
          {
            "label": "json",
            "value": "12"
          }
        ],
